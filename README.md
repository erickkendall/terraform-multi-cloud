# Terraform Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Terraform to manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform). It showcases the ability to create and manage common infrastructure resources in a consistent way across different cloud environments.

```

- `aws/`, `azure/`, `google/`: Contains provider-specific Terraform configurations.
- `modules/`: Reusable Terraform modules for each cloud provider.
- `environments/`: Environment-specific configurations.
- Root-level `.tf` files: Shared variables, outputs, and version constraints.

## Prerequisites

- Terraform v1.0.0 or newer
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Azure CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Google Cloud SDK configured with appropriate credentials

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-multi-cloud.git
   cd terraform-multi-cloud
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```

3. Review and modify the configurations in the respective provider directories as needed.

4. Plan your changes:
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

5. Apply the changes:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

## Environment-Specific Deployments

To deploy to a specific environment:

1. Navigate to the environment directory:
   ```
   cd environments/dev
   ```

2. Initialize and apply Terraform as described above.

## Adding New Resources

1. Identify the appropriate provider and service category.
2. Create or modify the relevant `.tf` file in the corresponding directory.
3. If the resource is reusable, consider creating a module in the `modules/` directory.

## Best Practices

- Use consistent naming conventions across all resources.
- Utilize variables for values that might change between environments.
- Implement proper tagging for cost allocation and resource management.
- Regularly update the README with any significant changes to the project structure or usage instructions.
